Once upon a time there were three little computers
called Boris, Doris and Horace. One day Boris was having
difficulty opening a file.

"I just can't open this file!" said Boris sadly. "Maybe there's something
wrong with my H: drive."
"Maybe it's a network problem," said Doris. "I can't access the printer."
"And I can't get onto the Internet," said Horace.

Just then, along came the Nice Computer Manager.

"Hello computers!" said the Nice Computer Manager.
"Hello Nice Computer Manager!" said the computers.
"How are you all today?" asked the Nice Computer Manager.
"I can't open a file," said Boris, sadly.
"And I can't access the printer," said Doris, glumly.
"And I can't get onto the Internet," said Horace, gloomily.
"Don't worry," said the Nice Computer Manager. "You're all being replaced by
a shiney new laptop!"

The End.
